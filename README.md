# python-experiment
A small python project that relies on the Flask framework.

#### Prerequisites
 * Python 2.7.X (I used v2.7.6)
 * Pip 

Install required project-level packages by running the following comand in the project directory:
```shell
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*TODO: We should probably use a virtualenv here, rather than installing packages globally. Fix this.*
 
Run with the following command:
```shell
python python-experiment.py
```
